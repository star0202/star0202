### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate student from **Seoul**, **South Korea**, who loves **Mathematics**, **Computer Science**, and **Music**.

ðŸ”§ Currently, I'm working on [**@team-crescendo**](https://github.com/team-crescendo) and [**@koreanbots**](https://github.com/koreanbots).

ðŸ’¡ I believe in the power of community and open source. That's why I'm contributing to open-source projects and creating my projects.

ðŸ“« You can meet me on Discord **@starcea**, or you can send me an email to [**stardev.uwu@gmail.com**](mailto:stardev.uwu@gmail.com)

Feel free to explore my repositories and contribute to them. I'm always open to new ideas and suggestions. Let's shape the future of the world together! ðŸš€ðŸŒŽ
